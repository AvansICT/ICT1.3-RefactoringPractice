Some often-used refactorings. See the project folders for the exercises. 
Since these are so often used most IDE's offer refactoring actions for most of these but try to do these first without the tools so you get a feel for it. 

For some background and more refactoring patterns see the following sites:
* https://www.refactoring.com/catalog/
  * Martin Fowler's site, the original
* https://refactoring.guru/refactoring
  * Good site for step-by-step guidance.
